# Instructions

0. Make sure `node` and `npm` are installed by running `node -v` and `npm -v`. After that, make sure all dependencies (specified inside `package.json`) are installed by running `npm i`.

1. Run `npm run generate-dates` to generate new dataset into a file `loginsRecords.json`. This commands basically runs `python loginsRecords.py` commands which generates dates using the provided `seed.py`.

2. Run `npm start` to print the expected output. This command basically runs `index.js` using `Babel`.
Behind the scene, `index.js` imports 2 main files. One is `loginsRepository.js` which holds the logic related to the task, the other one is `utilities.js` which holds more generic functionalities which can be re-used across the system. We own't be needing a system for this task anyway, but I thought it's better this way. :)

3. Run `npm test` to run tests for `loginsRepository.js` and `utilities.js`.

Thanks for the challenge. It was fun!
